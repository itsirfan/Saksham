## Project - Saksham 

### This app has been created with a vision to empower women in Rural areas and provide them job opportunities with decent earnings. 

1. People living in the Urban areas, be it students or new residents, have problem finding domestic help or household workers.
2. Women in the rural areas have nominal opportunities to enhance their skill set and due to various limitations, they are unable to work and earn decent wages.
3. We’ll train the rural women and harness their skills so that they can find opportunities in the fields they are best at, through NGOs and Resources.
4. We’ll connect them with the employers who are willing to hire them in the nearby areas.

An app 'Saksham' has to be installed by the User who is seeking household helpers or workers and through the Location services, they can set the range depending on their preferences (for instance, the workers should be near 5-10 kms of their residence). They can add the monthly wages they are willing to provide the helpers. If there are workers available in the nearby areas, they would be alloted to them based on their preferences.
