## Project - Saksham 

### This app has been created with a vision to empower women in Rural areas and provide them job opportunities with decent earnings. 

An app has to be installed by the User who is seeking household helpers or workers and through the Location services, they can set the range depending on their preferences (for instance, the workers should be near 5-10 kms of their residence). They can add the monthly wages they are willing to provide the helpers. If there are workers available in the nearby areas, they would be alloted to them based on their preferences.
